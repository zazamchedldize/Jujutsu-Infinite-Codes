            <h1>Jujutsu Infinite Codes (March 2025)</h1>
            <p1>As a fan of Jujutsu Kaisen, Roblox Jujutsu Infinite is giving me the RPG experience I never imagined. Unlike many other JJK games, this is a no-nonsense adaptation of the popular animanga series. Here, you can build your character from scratch to become the ultimate sorcerer while the combat and visuals take you to the true imagination of the animation series. To help you in your RPG journey, we have compiled Jujutsu Infinite codes that give you free spins. Use these spins to get better traits and abilities to become the strongest mage in Jujutsu Infinite.</p1>

            <h4>How To Get Domain Shard?</h4>
            <p4>In Jujutsu Infinite, Domain Shards are rare and valuable items that unlock powerful Domain Expansions for specific Innate Techniques. Acquiring them requires dedication due to their scarcity. Here's how you can obtain Domain Shards:</p4>
            <ul>
                <li1>1)Opening Chests:</li1>
                <p5>Domain Shards have a very low chance to drop from Grade Chests, which are rewards for completing missions via the Mission Board. To increase your chances, use luck-boosting items like Luck Vials or Lucky Cats before opening chests</p5>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                <li2>2)Purchasing from the Curse Market:</li2>
                <p5>Occasionally, Domain Shards appear in the Curse Market, where you can exchange high-value items such as Demon Fingers or Paralyzed Hands to acquire them. The market's inventory refreshes periodically, so check back regularly.</p5>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li3>3)Trading with Other Players</li3>
                <p6>Engaging in player-to-player trading within the Trade Hub allows you to exchange items for Domain Shards. This method depends on the availability and willingness of other players to trade.

                    Note: To utilize a Domain Shard, you must reach level 420 and fully master an Innate Technique that has an available Domain Expansion. Not all Innate Techniques have Domain Expansions, so verify your technique's capabilities in the Skills menu</p6>
